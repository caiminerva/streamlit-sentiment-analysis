1,I believe genetically modified foods are safe to consume because they undergo rigorous testing and are subject to regulatory oversight to ensure their safety.
0,"I think more research is needed to fully understand the potential health and environmental risks of genetically modified foods, and that there should be greater transparency in the regulatory process."
1,"I agree since they become the fast producing source of food nowadays. Yet, I think some may be safe to consume with more research and regulation conducted."
0,"Completely disagreed! Because genetically modified foods pose significant risks to human health and the environment, and that we need to prioritize alternative approaches such as organic farming and agroecology to ensure food safety and sustainability."
0,"Nope, I do not believe that genetically modified foods are safe to consume! As there are concerns about the potential for unintended consequences and the long-term impact on human health and the environment."
1,"Yes, I agree because genetically modified foods are generally safe to consume, but it's important to remain vigilant and address any potential risks as they arise."
0,"Big no! Genetically modified foods are not safe to consume, as there are still too many unknowns about their potential long-term effects."
1,Absolutely! GMOs have been extensively tested and regulated to ensure their safety for human consumption.
0,"Completely disagreed! I think that genetically modified foods are not safe to consume, as they may have negative effects on biodiversity and the environment, and we need to prioritize more sustainable and natural methods of food production."
1,"Yes because I believe that genetically modified foods are safe to consume, as the benefits they offer in terms of improving crop yields and addressing food insecurity outweigh the potential risks."
1,Yes. It is because it has been thoroughly researched and tested to assure its safety as well as benefits for the consumer
1,"According to Research, it is safe for it provides more nutrients than non genetically modified food. It is also cheaper. As well as it uses less pesticide, thus, lessens the harmful effects to human health. Lastly, it makes the grow of plants faster than non genetically modified foods. "
1,"Before producing a genetically modified food, numerous scientist were involved in studying that certain subject with regards also on the safety of consuming it. Now, once it will be out in the market it simply means that the research produced were a success and a thoroughly process was indicated so with that genetically modified food are safe to consumed."
0,It’s not safe for the health for I believe that there are risks upon consuming them.
1,To explore GMO and its potential as food source.
0,"Nope, because I don’t like it and how it is implemented."
1,"Yes, I agree that GM foods are safe to consume. From what I've read and heard, the scientific consensus is that GMO foods are safe."
0,"I strongly disagree that GM foods are safe to consume. There is still so much we don't know about the long-term effects of consuming GM foods, and I don't think it's worth the risk."
0,"Nope! I have heard conflicting opinions about their safety when consuming them. I think more research is needed to fully understand the potential risks and benefits, and until then, I'm cautious about consuming GM foods."
1,"I think that GM foods are probably safe to consume, but I can understand why some people might be skeptical or concerned. It's important to remember that everyone's body is different, and what's safe for one person may not be safe for another. "
1,"I agree! I think due to technological advancements, new methods on producing food are being researched. I think I might try one."
